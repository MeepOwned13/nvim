# Nvim config

My current nvim config

For stuff to work on windows:

- NVIM environment variable: nvim config root dir (Win: located in AppData/Local/)
- MASON_INSTALL environmet variable: install location
- bypass WindowsApps python3 bs
- install npm (node-[something])
- have a C compiler
- make sure to have glsl_analyzer in path (https://github.com/nolanderc/glsl_analyzer)
- packer may require setting safe directory (use " instead of ')
